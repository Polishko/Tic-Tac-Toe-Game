# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
A simple tic-tac-toe colsole game

This game can be played with two players or one player vs. computer. Please use the relevant code files.

The last file is the Turkish version of the game which I wrote for my nieces. They live far in Didim, Turkey. It's the most colorful version of the game for now. The code is an improved version of the original and I added a re-play option too.

The first two files which are in English are to be improved as well.

Here is a link to the Turkish version in Replit: https://replit.com/@polishko/Iki-kisilik-uc-tas-oyunu-Turkce#
